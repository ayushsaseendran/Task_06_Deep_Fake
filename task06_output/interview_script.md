**Interviewer:** Thanks for joining us today! Could you start by explaining what dataset you worked with?  
**Expert:** Sure. I analyzed the 2025 Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse team statistics, which were collected from the official season PDF. It included the team’s game results, scores, and performance metrics.  

**Interviewer:** And what was your main objective with this analysis?  
**Expert:** The goal was to test how Large Language Models, like ChatGPT, could interpret structured sports data and answer natural questions, such as win–loss records, scoring patterns, and standout games.  

**Interviewer:** What kind of insights were you able to generate?  
**Expert:** For example, the analysis confirmed the total number of games the team played, highlighted the distribution of wins and losses, and identified which games had the highest and lowest scores.  

**Interviewer:** Were there any particular patterns in the team’s performance?  
**Expert:** Yes. The team showed strong scoring trends in home games compared to away games, and there were noticeable variations in performance against higher-ranked opponents.  

**Interviewer:** How accurate were the AI-generated answers compared to the raw data?  
**Expert:** Generally accurate, though one challenge was making sure the AI did not misinterpret missing data from the PDF. With careful prompting, the answers aligned well with the actual statistics.  

**Interviewer:** Did you encounter any technical hurdles?  
**Expert:** Definitely. Converting the PDF into a clean CSV was tricky. There were formatting issues and missing values, which required preprocessing before the data could be used effectively.  

**Interviewer:** How did you structure your workflow overall?  
**Expert:** First, I parsed the PDF into a structured file, then I used a Jupyter Notebook to compute descriptive statistics. Finally, I prompted the LLM with natural-language questions and compared its responses with the computed stats.  

**Interviewer:** So in the end, what does this experiment tell us?  
**Expert:** It demonstrates that LLMs can act as effective data interpreters, especially when guided with good prompts. They can turn raw statistics into narratives or summaries that are accessible to non-technical audiences.  

**Interviewer:** That’s a fascinating application. Thank you for sharing your insights!  
**Expert:** My pleasure—thank you for having me.
